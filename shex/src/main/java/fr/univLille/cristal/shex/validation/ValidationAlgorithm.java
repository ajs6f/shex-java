/** <p>Allows to validate a graph against a ShEx schema.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A {@link ValidationAlgorithm} must be initialized with an {@link RDFGraph} and a {@link ShexSchema}.
 * Then the {@link #validate(Resource, ShapeLabel)} method allows to construct a typing of the graph by the schema.
 * The {@link #getTyping()} method allows to retrieve the typing constructed by {@link #validate(Resource, ShapeLabel)}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The method {@link #validate(Resource, ShapeLabel)} can take as parameter a node and a shape label, which both can be <code>null</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If both are null, then {@link #validate(Resource, ShapeLabel)} constructs the complete typing of the graph by the shex schema.
 * If the focus node is not null, the constructed typing is guaranteed to be complete only for the given node.
 * If the shape label is not null, the constructed typing is guaranteed to be complete only for the given shape label.
 * In all cases, the constructed typing is a subset of the complete typing, thus is correct w.r.t. to the semantics of ShEx schemas.
 * In all cases, the constructed typing is locally valid for all node. That is, all node-label association can be shown correct within this typing.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For example, this is how to test whether a particular node satisfies a given type.</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * RDFGraph graph = new JenaRDFGraph(model); // with model of class org.apache.jena.rdf.model.Model

 * Resource focusNode = ... // the node that we want to validate 
 * ShapeLabel label = ... // the type to be checked on that node 
 * validate(focusNode, label)

 * </pre>
 *
